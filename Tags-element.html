    <h1> Tags and element</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2> HTML element</h2>
    <p> An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. </p>
    <p> Most HTML elements are written with a start tag (or opening tag) and an end tag (or closing tag), with content in between. Elements can also contain attributes that define its additional properties. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the p element, would be written as: </p>
<div>
    <img src="/images/html-element.jpeg" alt="Element syntax element">
</div>
<p> we learn about the HTML Pagea <a href="demo.html">next chapter</a></p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The block-level elements should not be placed within inline-level elements. For example, the <p> element should not be placed inside the <b> element.</p>
        <h2> HTML Elements Types</h2>
        <p>Technically, an HTML element is the collection of start tag, its attributes, an end tag and everything in between. On the other hand an HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of an element, as you can see in the above illustration</p>
<p>However, in common usage the terms HTML element and HTML tag are interchangeable i.e. a tag is an element is a tag. For simplicity's sake of this website, the terms "tag" and "element" are used to mean the same thing â€” as it will define something on your web page</p>
<h2> BLOCK INLINE Element</h2>
<strong>HTML Elements Types</strong>
<p> Elements can be placed in two distinct groups: block level and inline level elements. The former make up the document's structure, while the latter dress up the contents of a block.</p>
<p>Also, a block element occupies 100% of the available width and it is rendered with a line break before and after. Whereas, an inline element will take up only as much space as it needs.</p>
<p>The most commonly used block-level elements are &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;, &lt;form&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, and so on. Whereas, the commonly used inline-level elements are &lt;img&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;code&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;button&gt;, etc</p>
<P>You will learn about these elements in detail in upcoming chapters</P>
<p>strong>Note:</strong>The block-level elements should not be placed within inline-level elements. For example, the <p> element should not be placed inside the <b> element.</b></p>
