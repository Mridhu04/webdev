    <h2>Creating Your First HTML Document</h2>
    <p>Let's walk through the following steps. At the end of this tutorial, you will have made an HTML file that displays "Hello world" message in your web browser.</p>
    <h3> Step 1: Creating the HTML file</h3>
    Open up your computer's plain text editor and create a new file.
    <h3>Step 2: Type some HTML code</h3>
    Start with an empty window and type the following code:
    <pre><code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt; 
        &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;A simple HTML document&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; 
        &lt;body&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;p&gt;
         &lt;/body&gt;
         &lt;/html&gt;
        </code></pre>
     <h3>Step 3: Saving the file</h3>
        Now save the file on your desktop as "myfirstpage.html ".
         <h3> Explanation of code</h3>
        You might wonder what that code was all about. Well, let's find out.
        <ul> 
        The first line &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is the document type declaration. It instructs the web browser that this document is an HTML5 document. It is case-insensitive.&lt;/li&gt;
        The &lt;head&gt; element is a container for the tags that provides information about the document, for example, &lt;title&gt; tag defines the title of the document.&lt;/li&gt;
        The &lt;body&gt; element contains the document's actual content (paragraphs, links, images, tables, and so on) that is rendered in the web browser and displayed to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
        <P> You will learn about the different HTML elements in detail in the upcoming chapters. For now, just focus on the basic structure of the HTML document.</P>
        <P> <strong>Note:</strong> !DOCTYPE declaration appears at the top of a web page before all other elements; however the doctype declaration itself is not an HTML tag. Every HTML document requires a document type declaration to insure that your pages are displayed correctly.
            Tip: The &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; tags make up the basic skeleton of every web page. Content inside the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; are invisible to users with one exception: the text between &lt;title&gt; and &lt;/title&gt; tags which appears as the title on a browser tab.&lt;/P&gt;</p>
