    <p> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is the basic building block of World Wide Web.</p>
    Hypertext is text displayed on a computer or other electronic device with references to other text that the user can immediately access, usually by a mouse click or key press.
    <p>Apart from text, hypertext may contain tables, lists, forms, images, and other presentational elements. It is an easy-to-use and flexible format to share information over the Internet.
        Markup languages use sets of markup tags to characterize text elements within a document, which gives instructions to the web browsers on how the document should appear.</p>
